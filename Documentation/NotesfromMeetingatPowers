Project Meeting #2 (power’s)


Git coding exists- should be easy

Use existing code as a reference but still doing our own

Prefer hard way – as a symbolic gesture even we fail, still trying

Invite Andrew to Tuesday meeting if Monday class time is unsatisfactory

Easier way might not suffice as a project-

Meet with Andrew about using open source versus our own code and what he would accept as a project…

Arthur- html css website design help!


Virtual Machines – really hard and really complicated
Are they necessary for our project? 
I think we just need a server

Use servers that already at  the school

Website—
Decided that both are going to do code academy to just go over basic html 

Programming-
Can access repository from server = easy 
Merge is the most important 


Read background php for help
Focused more on reading code for info 
Learning PHP on Monday in class
There are codes that already exist 



Upload research that you’ve done and look at all the stuff. 
If you need help—ask group members! Or Andrew

Repos exist on master server and then are just places where ou can share different info from different places. 
Client Server system- lives on the server but can be accessed from different computers and different clients. 

Version Control- keeps track of latest version and syncs you to it. Latest working copy. – commit

Ask Andrew for a tutorial on how to look at source code—helpful (email!)

Watch video on scrum and how they created github

Next meeting at 12:15 in the cat lab ON TUESDAY!

Put summary paragraph of research with links of where you found information and where to find more
