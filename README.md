Git-Project
===========

Class-related project to create a code hosting website, based on the git model.

Introduction
  Github is a well known and widely used repository host for code (lots of other data as well e.g. this README). Recently, the Github group has come under fire for sexists practices against female employees. Further, sexist practices are likely a reflection of the wider "boys club" mentality that is pervasive in the computing industry. As a firm rebuttal against the sexists practices at Github, we are going to construct a git repository system that mimics the functionality of github.
